TV Venn
=======

My roommates and I thought it would be illuminating to see what TV shows we all watched. Luckily I am a web developer with nothing better to do, so ta-da here it is. Eternal gratitude to Ben Frederickson's Venn Diagram library built on top of D3. Check it out here: https://github.com/benfred/venn.js. Live at http://mackenco.github.io/tv_venn/.
